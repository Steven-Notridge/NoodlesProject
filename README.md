# NoodlesProject

After deciding to review a bunch of Instant Noodles available at a local Chinese Superstore, I've debated how I can incorporate some form of DevOps into it. It's going to start with some basic use of Python. I'll be using this to also figure out how Git works, so I can transfer between devices on my Windows Desktop, my Linux Desktop and Laptop. Once I've finally got all the data collected, I'll be over-engineering the entire thing.

Project is now on hold for time being. Other, more important studying has taken over.
