Nissin Damae Ramen,4,4,0,5,£0.70,Chicken,Sesame,Classic,Allrounder,Solid,"Chicken, Soup, Sesame, Herbs","The broth is fantastic. Classic Chicken flavouring and not too overpowering. I'd say the packets description of a 'soup' is perfect for this one. Initial confusion and correction over artificial taste, but I realised this was actually the aftertaste of the Sesame oil. May be one of the best broth's I'll get to review!"
Unif 100,3,4,0,4,£0.98,Pork Chop,Oil,Filling,Heavy,Solid,"Herbs, Pork, Fat","Straight away the instructions were a little weird. It stated you 'boil the water then add to bowl with noodles and seasoning, cover for 3 mins and serve.' So I instead done it the same way as Nissin does, put the seasoning into the bowl, boil the noodles with the water and pour the water into the bowl, mix then add noodles. Overall, a damn good surprise. The smell doesn't reflect the taste, but the broth was really good. It's a little odd I can't lie, but perhaps I've never really tried beefy/pork noodles before. Usually they're just Chicken, so probably worth taking that into consideration regarding my rating of the Broth and flavour. "
MAMA,5,4,1,4,£0.75,Hot and Spicy,None,Spicy,Powerful,Accurate,"Herbs, Spicy, Chillies, Chilli","The red broth is scary. First mouthful, instant heat, can feel it burn down the back of my throat, slight tickle inside of my mouth, maybe comparable to biting a jalapeno on its own. After several mouthfuls i've gotten used to it and its not that spicy. Might give it a 5/10 on spice. It's got a nice level, possibly optimal. My lips are going a bit numb though. After trying some of the broth too, I'd bump the spicy levels to a fair 6/10. It's not overwhelming and has a really nice heat level. The broth is quite strong, and quite literally tastes of Red Chillies. This would probably be really nice with some additional veggies and a few strips of chicken. Definitely one for adding stuff into. Just be aware, it literally just tastes of chillies and towards the end had this kind of weird strangeness to it, hence the point on artificial."
Nongshim,5,3,1,3,£0.95,Seafood,None,Accurate,Plentiful,Spicy,"Spicy, Seafood, Champong, Herbs, Squid, Fish","Well, it is Seafood flavoured, and it's kind of obvious but my god does it stink. Despite the smell, they're actually quite nice from the initial taste. Like a spicy squid flavour, but the squid flavour isnt that strong when eating the noodles. There's small pieces of fish or squid? I dunno, something i just chewed on felt like it! The broth is nice but something lets it down, you'd have to really love the taste of squid to get behind this one. The spicyness isn't that strong, but in the broth it's got a weird artificial sort of blend to it that I'm not very fond of. There's like, a smokyness to the squid aftertaste that doesn't sit right. I think it's fair to say, they're better than I expected, worse than I hoped. I also chose to use Plentiful as a keyword, because this might be the second biggest portion you can get for your money. At 124g, and the herbs/spices that came with it were a lot bigger than you'd expect."
Unif 100,1,1,5,1,£0.98,Beef,Oil,Aniseed,Plain,Disappointing,"Tapout, Nasty, Beef, Roasted, Herbs, Fat, Aniseed","Just to note. It literally says 'Artificial Roasted Beef' so hopefully it doesn't taste odd. As I'm cooking, I poured the seasoning packet into the bowl as per instructions, and there's a distinctive smell. after checking ingredients, there's aniseed in it. Initial taste of noodles, just pure aniseed, exactly what I was expecting. Aniseed in general is just so strong, I'm surprised they added it to these noodles. I'm almost finished with them, and these are by far some of the worst noodles I've had. The aniseed is all there is, there is literally zero beef flavour. Even in the broth, there is literally no resembelance to beef at all. What on earth is this packet... Maybe it's a culture thing, you must really like Aniseed to eat these because that's all it is. Disappointing."
"Guang You Chongqing

",1,1,3,1,£0.00,Sweet Potato,Vinegar,Aniseed,Disappointing,Disgusting,"Tapout, Nasty, Herbs","Literally no instructions on how to make these. I put everything into a bowl, added 400ml of boiling water, covered for 3 mins then stirred, covered for 2 and served. They smell horrible, they taste horrible and they're definitely the spiciest yet. Gonna tapout, they're just awful, what is it with aniseed in noodles. The seasoning is bay leaves, cinnamon, ginger and star anise. Couldn't find the pricing on the receipt, it has a weird name and was mostly in another language."
MAMA,3,4,1,4,£0.60,Pork,Oil,Classic,Allrounder,Solid,"Pork, Fat, Palm Oil","Not much to say about this one, a solid choice for the entry into making noodles. The broth is tasty, the flavours nice and the chilli isn't very strong, though adds a nice kick to the broth. It's nothing special, but does well overall."
Nongshim,5,4,0,3,£0.70,Hot and Spicy,None,Spicy,Allrounder,Solid,Sutah,"Real name is Sutah Ramen. Doesn't smell too spicy, got a nice fiery red color broth. Also one of the more larger packets of noodles I've gotten. "
Samyang,4,4,0,5,£1.00,Beef,None,Spicy,Allrounder,Solid,"Spicy, Herbs, Beef","Real name is Sogokimyun. Smells pretty good overall. Can't say it's like, beef flavour but its got that beefy sort of, taste to it I suppose. Possibly the second largest packet in the batch. I've gotta say, overall this was a really good bowl of ramen. I stated earlier that it doesnt have much of a beefy flavour, but I think the flavourings kind of settled at the bottom of the bowl because once I got some bigger sips of broths, it was amazing. This may be the best beefy/meaty noodles out there. To think it could rival the Nissin Chicken noodles, was nothing but a beautiful surprise."
Nissin Damae Ramen,5,4,0,4,£0.70,Spicy Sesame,Sesame,Allrounder,Solid,Warming,"Warm, Sesame, Soup","I can just imagine having a bowl of this on a Winters day and feeling good about life. Nissin really nail these noodles. Absolutely nothing bad about it, this would be great with bits of chicken or pork, and veggies. It's not very spicy, but has more of a chilli kind of taste to it. "
Nongshim,5,4,0,4,£1.00,Spicy,None,Hot,Plentiful,Solid,"Herbs, Spicy, Chillies, Chilli, Soup","Also known as Shin Ramyun Noodles. Pretty spicy, having to take small breaks to collect myself. Really nice taste, same again with the other ones, just a rounded red chilli sort of flavour but it's nice and warming. Have to give it a 5 on accuracy. They said they're spicy, and they are indeed spicy. Really nice overall, would definitely go well with some additional chicken bits or something of the like. Nongshim delivered on this one, I don't think the others have been as spicy as this and saying that, I'd give it a 7/10 for spicyness. It's easy to escape the heat, but comes back quick once you start eating again. Lips a bit numb from the spice."
MAMA,3,5,0,3,£0.70,Kimchi,None,Spicy,Surprising,Tasty,"Herbs, Spicy","Smells better than expected given it's supposed to be Kimchi. I'm not the biggest fan of the actual food, but it's okay in small doses. My god. Amazing. I loved the taste of these, but I can't say they were close to what Kimchi, at least from what I know, is. I'd be going of Wagamama's version of Kimchi, though I admit I'm definitely uncultured for that particular food. The taste of these and the herbs were so damn good. I've given the broth a 3, because there wasnt much by the time I got to the end and it wasn't very tasty. I think the noodles soak it all up so it's more on that level. If it Broth wasn't a score, and you wanted to push out in terms of noodles, please. Buy these. MAMA really knows what they're doing with Noodles."
Nissin Damae Ramen,2,3,0,3,£0.70,Seafood,None,Plain,Neutral,Weak,"Seafood, Soup","Not too potent. The soup powder had a really horrible artificial smell to it though, but once I'd mixed it with water it was fine. Sometimes these include chilli powder or some form of oil but this has nothing. Just plain and simple seafood flavour apparently. After finishing the bowl, it kinda reminds me of their chicken flavour. It's almost like they used the same base soup as it has this kind of chickeny broth flavour to it with a hint of seafood. Rather than this being seafood flavoured, i'd describe it that way instead. 'Chicken with Seafood flavourings.' It's not that this was a bad packet, if anything they were kind of good, but there just isn't much going for it. It's very neutral. Like, even if you didn't like seafood, you'd probably still eat these anyway because it's not that bad. But then, there's nothing that really stands out about them, they just kind of, exist in the instant ramen world. I suppose if you added other seafood pieces like shrimp it'd stand out more but I dunno if i'd do that. Not sure, but either way, Nissin still do a good job at the instant ramen game."
Nissin Damae Ramen,2,3,1,3,£0.70,Beef,Oil,Plain,Weak,Aniseed,"Palm Oil, Beef, Aniseed","Oh no... I smell aniseed. I didn't see it in the ingredients though. It must be the flavouring of Beef in asian countries, but this doesn't really resemble beef. It did say on the packet 'five spice beef'. One of those spices is indeed Star Anise. It was better than the Unif 100 version for sure, but it still isn't anything special. There's a sort of smokeyness on the broth but eh. "
Nongshim,5,4,0,4,£1.00,Spicy Beef,None,Heavy,Solid,Spicy,"Yukgaejang, Spicy, Herbs, Beef","No Aniseed smell! Exciting to taste a beef flavour that doesn't have it! It does have a slightly beefy undertone. The 'hot' side of it kinda reminds me of sriracha sauce. It's like a sweet chilli kind of taste. After finishing, I'd say these are the best Beef flavoured noodles out there. Nongshim really know their noodles. The packet has a lot of noodles, a good amount of broth, solid flavours and is also the most expensive, though for a reason. The broth itself was amazing, with some nice meatyness to it as well as the aftertaste of chillies. On a scale I'd probably put these at 4/10 in spicyness. A nice warm heat, enough to make your nose run a little by the end of the entire bowl. On a cold winters day, these would be amazing with some mushrooms."
Nissin Damae Ramen,4,4,0,4,£0.70,Black Garlic Oil,Oil,Salty,Flavourful,Heavy,"Tonkotsu, Garlic, Palm Oil","It says Black Garlic Oil followed by Tonkotsu flavour. No idea what this is. It's definitely got garlic in it, it's quite strong. Not sure what's black about it though because it doesn't look anything like the packaging. It's very tasty, but also quite salty. I'm starting to think the 'black' part of the flavour is Soy Sauce. After googling Tonkotsu, it's apparently 'pig bone' which is how they make the broth. There was definitely some meaty undertones as I was thinking about Nissin's chicken version whilst I was eating it. This makes more sense now. It still had a rather salty taste to it, like soy sauce or something. I personally am not too sure I'd buy this again, but I can't give it lower points based on that opinion. In terms of flavour and broth, it was pretty solid, I don't really have anything to complain about."
Nongshim,3,1,2,1,£0.95,Sweet Onion,Oil,Heavy,Plentiful,Disappointing,"Chapagetti, Onion","Apparently a Sweet Onion with Meaty undertones. Doesn't smell great, there's not really any broth either. I tried some and frankly, it tastes like burnt onions. Not really a fan, it's gone to a really sticky texture and the noodles are kinda chewy. I like onions, I'd eat one raw if I had to, but this ain't it chief. Not for me."
MAMA,4,4,0,4,£0.60,Spicy Pork,Oil,Flavourful,Scarce,Solid,"Pork, Palm Oil, Spicy","Smells quite meaty as I'm cooking it. I didn't think there was gonna be any broth but it looks like we've got some. If I cooked it anymore it'd definitely be overcooked. Well, Broth was amazing, noodles were great but overall I think they could be better. I'd wish they'd use the same noodles and method as Nissin Damae Ramen, and have a lot more broth. These were amazing otherwise but they just lacked in the amount you get. They are technically the cheapest reviewed up until now but I wouldn't really want to use two packs for one meal, it's a little excessive. "
MAMA,3,2,1,0,£0.70,Spicy,Oil,Spicy,Disappointing,Scarce,"Mi Goreng, Spicy, Palm Oil","It smells alright, the packet had shrimp on it but google says Mi Goreng is a mix of things. For the record, I hate this already. It provides dried vegetables that you boil with the noodles but they're just sticking to the outside of the bowl because this doesn't have any broth in it. There was four packets inside the noodle packet too, so much fucking about. After consumption, these just suck. The noodles are chewy because there's no broth and you mix the spices in after they're cooked, the vegetables are literally a waste of time because you can't peel them off the side of the bowl and they don't sit in the noodles either. It's got an okay taste, not really shrimp or anything particular just kinda, spicy meaty taste I dunno. Might have been better with a dash of Sriracha if I'm honest. The amount of noodles you get, for the amount of pissing about, makes this packet pretty crap. I expect better from MAMA. Also weighing in at the second lowest packet and not even the cheapest available. Definitely not worth the effort or money for this one."
Unif 100,3,3,0,4,£0.98,Spicy Beef,Oil,Plentiful,Flavourful,Solid,"Beef, Spicy, Palm Oil, Herbs","Please Unif. No more aniseed. It doesn't say anything in the ingredients so I'm hopeful... After cooking, these smell great. Actually quite excited for this. Are Unif 100 going to redeem themselves? After eating, I believe they have. I don't think it was spicy at all though, at most it was like, warm. Not even got a runny nose so it's not at a very high level and perhaps they just meant the taste of Spicy Beef. Overall this was pretty good, but it's not like, insane compared to some of the others out there. The broth had a nice meaty undertone whilst having some nice chilli tones to it. I wouldn't say straight away like, hey buy this one, but I'd definitely say, if you see it, give it a try and see what you think. "
Nissin Damae Ramen,3,3,1,3,£0.70,Prawn,None,Plentiful,Solid,Heavy,"Prawn, Seafood, Soup","Do not get close to the seasoning packet and smell it. Your head will be blown off. Potent stuff. As I'm eating, yet again reminds me of the same sorta chicken broth base they seem to use in all their packets, with a hint of prawn. After eating, it's not as strong as you'd expect which is kind of nice, might be a little disappointing if you really enjoy these flavours though. I don't think it's very like, flavourful but enough to make the average person get through it. I think some of the other seafood flavours were a bit better."
Unif 100,4,3,0,4,£0.98,Beef with Sauerkraut,Oil,Spicy,Heavy,Flavourful,"Beef, Sauerkraut, Sour, Acidic, Herbs, Spicy, Palm Oil","Sauerkraut is fermented cabbage. Smelt more like pickles to be honest. As I'm eating, I can't help but wonder if this would be a lot better than their original beef flavour, without the Sauerkraut added to it. The cabbage is very strong, and is quite overpowering. There is some form of beef undertones but ultimately it's buried too deeply. My nose is running from a bit of spice but I don't think it's very spicy, it's quite warm, which was a neat bonus. I'm not sure how to rate this as I've never tasted Sauerkraut before. The Broth is nice, but then you're hit with a strong vinegar style taste from the Sauerkraut. I don't think I'll finish it, as I don't really enjoy using vinegar. This might be a hit for those that do. It's very flavourful however, and is surprisingly nice, better than I expected without a doubt. I'd definitely buy this pack and try again without the cabbage though, since their original beef version is packed with Aniseed. I think I'll give this one some decent marks because overall it's quite tasty, but I just don't know if it's for me. "
Nissin Damae Ramen,4,4,0,5,£0.70,Soy Sauce,Soy,Plentiful,Heavy,Salty,"Soy, Soup","Smelt pretty nice before cooking. As I've almost finished it without realising I didnt type, this one slaps. It's quite salty, but has this banging smoky mushroom tone to the dark soy sauce flavour. I personally feel like i've accurately described this pack haha. It's really nice, the broth is so heavy and flavourful. Man this is really good, there's gotta be some form of meaty sidenotes, because it's a unique flavour. "
Nongshim,2,3,0,2,£1.00,Kimchi,None,Plentiful,Neutral,Plain,"Herbs, Soup, Kimchi, Vegetarian","The powder was very peppery, was making me cough as I was cooking it. Don't taste much of it in the actual ramen though. As I'm eating it, I can't help but think like... where is the flavour? It's Kimchi flavoured, and had some dried kimchi to cook up, but it's just bland. It's got a tiny bit of heat to it, not really enough to notice to be honest. I've finished the bowl and I can't help but think I cooked them wrong, but I don't think I did. Don't get me wrong right, these aren't exactly BAD. But they definitely lack overall in just... taste. There is a taste there but it's just so weak, like, what am I actually eating? It's like talking to a girl at a club, and she's trying to tell you something but the musics too loud, so you just end up nodding instead."
