Nissin Damae Ramen,4,4,0,5,£0.70,Chicken,Sesame,Classic,Allrounder,Solid,"Chicken, Soup, Sesame, Herbs","The broth is fantastic. Classic Chicken flavouring and not too overpowering. I'd say the packets description of a 'soup' is perfect for this one. Initial confusion and correction over artificial taste, but I realised this was actually the aftertaste of the Sesame oil. May be one of the best broth's I'll get to review!"
Unif 100,3,4,0,4,£0.98,Pork Chop,Fat,Filling,Heavy,Solid,"Herbs, Pork, Fat","Straight away the instructions were a little weird. It stated you 'boil the water then add to bowl with noodles and seasoning, cover for 3 mins and serve.' So I instead done it the same way as Nissin does, put the seasoning into the bowl, boil the noodles with the water and pour the water into the bowl, mix then add noodles. Overall, a damn good surprise. The smell doesn't reflect the taste, but the broth was really good. It's a little odd I can't lie, but perhaps I've never really tried beefy/pork noodles before. Usually they're just Chicken, so probably worth taking that into consideration regarding my rating of the Broth and flavour. "
MAMA,5,4,1,4,£0.75,Hot and Spicy,None,Spicy,Powerful,Accurate,"Herbs, Spicy, Chillies, Chilli","The red broth is scary. First mouthful, instant heat, can feel it burn down the back of my throat, slight tickle inside of my mouth, maybe comparable to biting a jalapeno on its own. After several mouthfuls i've gotten used to it and its not that spicy. Might give it a 5/10 on spice. It's got a nice level, possibly optimal. My lips are going a bit numb though. After trying some of the broth too, I'd bump the spicy levels to a fair 6/10. It's not overwhelming and has a really nice heat level. The broth is quite strong, and quite literally tastes of Red Chillies. This would probably be really nice with some additional veggies and a few strips of chicken. Definitely one for adding stuff into. Just be aware, it literally just tastes of chillies and towards the end had this kind of weird strangeness to it, hence the point on artificial."
